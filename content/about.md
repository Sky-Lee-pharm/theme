<p text-align:center;>Hi, my name is li Hao. I am so happy creating this blog to record my life and ideas. My personality is introverted, which makes me more creative and equanimous. I like singing and reciting the poem on the stage. During my spare time, I love to watch and learn a few musical songs. I graduated from Shenyang pharmaceuticl university, majoring in Chinese medicine pharmacy. When I was young, my fitness was terrible. How lucky I am, which met the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to take good care of my health. The theory of TCM is dialectical treatment, which led me to the gate of philosophy.

During my work and study, I tryed to reinstall the windows system and skillfully used Microsoft office. However, as the windows system crashed frequently, I met the chromeOS laptop, which opened the world of open source and my route of data analysis. I taught myself Linux operating systems and used R language, python, gimp, VMD, etc. software to complete my academic thesis. I always have curiosity and learn ability in an unfamiliar territory.</p></div>
